1. What is the role of IAM roles and policies?
IAM Roles:
IAM roles grant temporary permissions to AWS services or users. They are assumed by entities like EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or users.

IAM Policies:
Policies define permissions. They can be attached to users, groups, or roles to grant or restrict access to AWS resources.

2. Can you explain the Terraform plan and its purpose?
The terraform plan command provides an execution plan before applying changes. It shows what resources will be created, modified, or destroyed without making actual changes.

3. What is AWS Lambda, and how does it work?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events. It executes functions without provisioning or managing servers.

4. How do you invoke a Lambda function, and where do you configure it?
You can invoke a Lambda function:

Manually via the AWS CLI, SDK, or Console
Event-driven via S3, DynamoDB, SNS, API Gateway, etc.
Configuration is done in the AWS Lambda console, AWS CLI, or Terraform.

5. Can you describe how Lambda handles scaling and event-based invocations?
Scaling: Lambda scales automatically by running multiple instances in parallel.
Event-based invocations: Triggers from services like S3, DynamoDB, or API Gateway invoke the function.
6. What is Amazon CloudWatch, and have you configured any custom metrics?
Amazon CloudWatch monitors AWS resources and applications. Yes, you can configure custom metrics using the AWS SDK, CLI, or CloudWatch Agent.

7. What metrics are available on your CloudWatch dashboard?
Common metrics include:

EC2: CPU utilization, disk I/O, network traffic
Lambda: Invocation count, duration, error rate
S3: Request count, bytes transferred
8. How do you configure CPU utilization on your CloudWatch dashboard?
Go to CloudWatch > Dashboards
Click Add widget > Select Metrics
Choose EC2 > CPUUtilization
Set thresholds for alerts (e.g., if CPU > 80%)
9. How do you attach an SSL certificate to an S3 bucket?
S3 itself doesnâ€™t support SSL directly, but you can:

Use CloudFront with an SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
Attach the certificate in Application Load Balancer (ALB) if serving via EC2.
10. What type of encryption have you implemented in your project?
S3: Server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS)
RDS: At-rest encryption using AWS KMS
EBS: Volume encryption
IAM Secrets Manager: Encrypted credentials
11. If an S3 bucket has a read-only policy, can you modify objects in the bucket?
No, a read-only policy only allows viewing objects, not modifications.

12. Why did you choose Terraform over Boto3 for infrastructure provisioning?
Terraform: Declarative, maintains infrastructure state, easy rollback
Boto3: Procedural, requires custom scripting
Terraform is better for managing entire infrastructure, whereas Boto3 is good for automation tasks.
13. What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN), and how does it work?
A CDN distributes content across edge locations to improve latency and speed. AWS CloudFront is a CDN that caches content closer to users.

14. Have you created a Jenkins pipeline for your project?
Yes, Jenkins pipelines automate CI/CD workflows for build, test, and deployment.

15. How do you attach policies to IAM users, either individually or by group?
You can attach policies:

Individually via the IAM console, CLI, or Terraform.
By Group (recommended) so users inherit policies.
16. What type of deployment strategies are you using in your project?
Common deployment strategies:

Rolling deployment
Blue/Green deployment
Canary deployment
Serverless deployment (Lambda)
17. Have you used any tools to create customized Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)?
Yes, Packer and EC2 Image Builder are used to create AMIs.

18. What is connection draining, and how does it work?
Connection draining ensures active connections complete before terminating EC2 instances behind a load balancer.

19. How does an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distribute traffic?
ELB distributes traffic based on:

Round Robin (default for ALB/NLB)
Least Connections
Target-based routing
20. What is auto-scaling, and how does it work?
Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.

21. Can you describe the different types of Load Balancers and provide examples?
ALB (Application Load Balancer): Routes traffic based on URLs
NLB (Network Load Balancer): Routes traffic based on IPs
CLB (Classic Load Balancer): Older, less flexible
22. What is the maximum runtime for a Lambda function?
15 minutes.

23. What is the maximum memory size for a Lambda function?
10 GB.

24. How can you increase the runtime for a Lambda function?
Adjust the timeout setting in the Lambda configuration.

25. What automations have you performed using Lambda in your project?
S3 Event Processing
Auto-healing EC2
Security compliance monitoring
26. Why did you choose Terraform over Boto3 for infrastructure provisioning?
(Same as Q12) Terraform provides better state management and versioning.

27. What modules have you used in your Lambda function?
Common modules include boto3, pandas, requests, json, logging.

28. Have you created an SNS topic for your project?
Yes, for sending notifications to email, SMS, or Lambda triggers.

29. If you've exhausted IP addresses in your VPC, how would you provision new resources?
Expand CIDR block in the VPC.
Create a new subnet in another availability zone.
30. What is Groovy, and how is it used in Jenkins?
Groovy is a scripting language used in Jenkins Pipelines.

31. Why do you use Groovy in Jenkins, and where do you save Jenkins files?
Used for defining CI/CD pipelines. Jenkinsfiles are stored in repositories (GitHub, GitLab).

32. What is Ansible, and what is its purpose?
Ansible is an IaC tool for configuration management and automation.

33. What language do you use in Ansible?
YAML.

34. Where do you run Terraform code, remotely or locally?
Both, using Terraform Cloud, AWS CodeBuild, or local execution.

35. What is the purpose of access keys and secret keys in AWS?
They authenticate API requests.

36. What are Terraform modules, and have you used any in your project?
Reusable Terraform configurations. Example: VPC module, S3 module.

37. What environments have you set up for your project?
Dev, Staging, Production.

38. Do you use the same AWS account for all environments?
No, usually separate accounts are used for security.

39. Do you have separate Jenkins servers for each environment?
Yes, or use a single Jenkins server with different pipelines.

40. Where do you write and save your Lambda function code?
In AWS Lambda Console, S3, or Git repositories.
