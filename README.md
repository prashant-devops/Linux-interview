Let's talk about Linux  File System


 The top-level directory, the starting point of the entire file system.

/bin (Binaries)
 Essential command binaries used by both the system and all users.
 Contains executable programs like ls, cat, cp, mv, and more.

/boot (Boot)
 Files required for the system to boot up.
 Includes the kernel (vmlinuz or similar), bootloader (grub) and initrd/initramfs.

/dev (Devices)
 Special files representing devices connected to the system.
 Includes files for terminals, storage devices, network interfaces, etc.

/etc (Etcetera)
 Configuration files for the system and applications.
 Includes files for network settings, user accounts, system services, etc.

/home (Home)
 Contains home directories for each user on the system.
 Each user's home directory stores their personal files, settings and configurations.

/lib (Library)
 Essential shared libraries and kernel modules.
 Libraries are used by multiple programs and provide common functions.

/media (Media)
 Mount point for removable media like USB drives, CDs and DVDs.
 Automatically mounted when the device is plugged in.

/mnt (Mount)
 Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems.
 Used to access filesystems from other devices or network shares.

/opt (Optional)
 Reserved for add-on application software packages.

/proc (Process)
 A virtual filesystem providing information about running processes.
 Each process is represented by a numbered directory containing details like memory usage, environment variables, etc.

/root (Root User)
 Home directory of the root user (the system administrator).
 Not to be confused with the root directory (/).

/run (Run-time variable data)
 Stores volatile runtime data, including process IDs, sockets and other temporary files.
 This directory is cleared on boot.

/sbin (System Binaries)
 Essential system binaries used for system administration.
 Contains commands for booting, repairing, restoring the system, etc.

/srv (Service)
 Data for services provided by the system.

/sys (System)
 A virtual filesystem containing information about the system and hardware devices.

/tmp (Temporary)
 Holds temporary files created by programs and users.

/usr (Unix System Resources)
 Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data.

/var (Variable)
 Variable data files like log files, spool files and cache data.
 Content changes frequently, so it's separated from /usr.
